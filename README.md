# FileRecovery

This is a group project done for a Digital Forensics Course. It's a python script that takes in a .dd disk image as an argument, locates file signatures, and properly recover user generated files without corruption, and then generate a SHA-256 hash for each file recovered. It outputs the file name, the start offset, the end offset, the SHA-256, and then recovers the file to the directory.

## Technologies Used

Python

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo.
